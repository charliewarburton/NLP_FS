       " 'UK households and businesses have needed support from the financial system to weather the economic disruption associated with Covid-19 (Covid). The financial system has so far provided that support, reflecting the resilience that has been built up since the global financial crisis, and the extraordinary policy responses of the UK authorities.',\n",
       " 'Businesses have raised substantial external financing since the start of the Covid pandemic from banks and financial markets, to help finance their cash-flow deficits. Households’ debt-servicing burdens have fallen during that period, supported by payment deferrals from lenders. The extension of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has supported household incomes.',\n",
       " 'Although there have been encouraging developments on vaccines, the FPC, consistent with its remit, is focused on the range of downside risks that remain. These include risks that could arise from the evolution of the pandemic and consequent measures to protect public health, as well as from the transition to new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom.',\n",
       " 'The FPC judges that the UK banking system remains resilient to a wide range of possible economic outcomes. It has the capacity to continue to support businesses and households even if economic outcomes are considerably worse than currently expected. This reflects the build-up of substantial buffers of capital since the global financial crisis.',\n",
       " 'Over the course of 2020, major UK banks’ and building societies’ (‘banks’) aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio has increased to 15.8% at end-September, which is over three times higher than at the start of the global financial crisis. Over this period, they have provisioned for £20 billion of credit losses, although the effect on the capital ratio is reduced by the transitional relief of IFRS 9.',\n",
       " 'Some headwinds to banks’ capital ratios are therefore anticipated over coming quarters as unemployment rises, business insolvencies rise from current low levels, and risk weights on banks’ exposures increase. Nevertheless, the major UK banks can absorb credit losses in the order of £200 billion, much more than would be implied if the economy followed a path consistent with the MPC’s central forecast.',\n",
       " 'The FPC judges that the UK and global macroeconomic scenarios required to generate losses on this scale would need to be very severe with, for example, UK unemployment rising to more than 15%.',\n",
       " 'The FPC expects banks to use all elements of capital buffers as necessary, to continue to support the economy. Alongside the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), it is taking action to support the use of capital buffers.',\n",
       " 'The FPC is updating its guidance on the path for the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate. It now expects this rate to remain at 0% until at least 2021 Q4. Due to the usual 12-month implementation lag, any subsequent increase is not expected to take effect until 2022 Q4 at the earliest. The eventual pace of return to a standard 2% UK CCyB rate will depend on banks’ ability to rebuild capital while continuing to support households and businesses.',\n",
       " 'The FPC welcomes the PRA’s intention to return towards the standard framework for bank distributions. This reflects some reduction in the uncertainty related to Covid, and the ability of banks to withstand significant losses. The FPC recognises the importance of a stable and predictable capital framework which provides certainty to banks and facilitates the use of capital buffers where necessary.',\n",
       " 'Cutting support to the economy to avoid the use of capital buffers would be costly for the wider economy and consequently for banks themselves.',\n",
       " 'Financial sector preparations for the end of the transition period with the EU are now in their final stages. Most risks to UK financial stability that could arise from disruption to the provision of cross-border financial services at the end of the transition period have been mitigated. The mitigation of these risks reflects extensive preparations made by authorities and the private sector over a number of years.',\n",
       " 'However, financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise.',\n",
       " 'Market volatility could be reinforced in the event that some derivative users are not fully ready to trade with EU counterparties or on EU or EU-recognised trading venues. Financial institutions should continue taking measures to minimise disruption.',\n",
       " 'Irrespective of the particular form of the UK’s future relationship with the EU, and consistent with its statutory responsibilities, the FPC remains committed to the implementation of robust prudential standards in the UK. This will require maintaining a level of resilience that is at least as great as that currently planned, which itself exceeds that required by international baseline standards, as well as maintaining UK authorities’ ability to manage UK financial stability risks.',\n",
       " 'Mortgage credit conditions remain tighter than at the start of the year, particularly for high loan to value mortgages. This reflects reduced risk appetite from lenders due to the economic outlook, as well as operational constraints in meeting the current high demand for mortgages.',\n",
       " 'The FPC’s mortgage market Recommendations limit the proportion of new mortgages with high loan to income ratios, guarding against an increase in the number of highly indebted households.',\n",
       " 'The measures are structural and intended to remain in place through cycles in the mortgage market. The FPC’s last review of its Recommendations in 2019 found no evidence that they were having a material impact on mortgage availability overall since they were introduced in 2014. That has remained the case since.',\n",
       " 'The FPC periodically reviews its measures, including their calibration. It judges that changes over time in the risks faced by households mean the measures warrant a further review. That is under way and the FPC will report its conclusions in 2021.',\n",
       " 'In order to help limit the degree of economic scarring caused by Covid, work to increase the supply of longer-term, equity-like financing is increasingly important. The Bank, with HM Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority, has launched an industry working group to facilitate investment in productive finance.',\n",
       " 'Stablecoins are digital tokens that claim to maintain a stable value at all times, primarily in relation to existing national currencies. They could provide benefits to users but will be adopted widely and become successful as a means of payment only if they meet appropriate standards and confidence in their value is assured.',\n",
       " 'The FPC, along with many authorities internationally, is considering the potential effects on financial stability if stablecoins were to be adopted widely. A discussion paper on these issues will be published in due course by the Bank. That paper will also address issues that may arise in connection to the concept of a Central Bank Digital Currency — an electronic form of central bank money that could be used by households and businesses to make payments.',\n",
       " 'The FPC is also considering how the regulatory system should adapt to assure confidence in the value of stablecoins at all times, while supporting innovation, in an efficient way. Their users must be as sure of their ability to redeem their money in cash, at face value, at all times, as they are with private money ― commercial bank deposits ― that is in widespread circulation in the UK today.',\n",

As set out in the November 2020 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), this is expected to weigh on both UK and global GDP.',\n",
       " 'In November, there was encouraging news on three potential Covid vaccines. But the economic outlook remains exceptionally uncertain. It depends on the evolution of the pandemic and the measures taken to protect public health, as well as the response of households, businesses and financial markets to these developments. There is uncertainty around the nature of and transition to new trading arrangements between the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom.',\n",
       " 'Businesses have raised substantial external financing since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic from banks and financial markets, and many may have been able to finance their cash-flow deficits.',\n",
       " 'The cash-flow deficit bar considers only firms with deficits. The deficit after exhausting cash buffers assumes firms use up all their available cash. Net finance raised considers UK private non-financial corporates (and excludes some forms of finance, eg private equity) between March and October 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Some finance raised will not finance deficits, nor be raised by firms with deficits.',\n",
       " 'The ‘typical’ cash-flow deficit refers to the aggregate negative cash flows estimated from companies’ latest pre-Covid balance sheet data, measured before dividend distributions and share buybacks. ‘Typical’ finance raised is the average cumulative net finance raised between March and October for 2016–19 (not seasonally adjusted).',\n",
       " 'The cash-flow deficit figures shown are the maximum of the estimated ranges (£148 billion–£176 billion and, for the typical deficit, £90 billion–£100 billion). Cash buffers that could be exhausted is the mid-point of the estimated range (£87 billion–£97 billion).',\n",
       " 'If UK companies with available cash balances before this year used these to finance their cash-flow deficits, this would reduce the estimated deficit to around £90 billion. But the extent to which they would choose to do so is uncertain; many may prefer to preserve existing cash balances.',\n",
       " 'Since March, UK businesses have raised over £77 billion of net additional financing from banks and through access to financial markets. Supervisory intelligence suggests the vast majority of net bank lending over that period has been via government-backed loan schemes. Net bank lending to UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the year to October was more than 40 times higher than the 2016–19 average. By contrast, larger UK corporates have repaid bank loans in recent months but have at the same time issued equity and bonds. UK businesses’ cumulative net equity issuance in the year to October was over £18 billion — compared to negative cumulative net issuance on average for the same period between 2016 and 2019.',\n",
       " 'This net increase in finance, coupled with existing cash buffers, may have enabled many businesses to finance their cash-flow deficits in the period up to October. However, some businesses may need additional finance to bridge the renewed disruption to activity since then.',\n",
       " 'The estimate is a little lower than presented in the August 2020 Financial Stability Report (FSR) as, in aggregate, the effect of Government measures on cash-flow deficits is estimated to slightly more than offset the effect of the new restrictions.',\n",
       " 'The typical cash-flow deficit refers to aggregate negative cash flows before dividend distributions and share buybacks, according to latest available data.',\n",
       " 'The Government has confirmed that access to its three lending schemes — the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS), the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme — will be extended, to receive applications through to the end of January 2021. This will provide support to qualifying businesses that may require further financing during this phase of restrictions.',\n",
       " 'Reflecting the uncertain economic environment, the terms on loans not backed by government-backed schemes are tightening. Supervisory intelligence indicates that lenders have reduced loan limits or tightened their underwriting standards for certain sectors.',\n",
       " 'In addition, a large number of businesses — many of which are SMEs — have made claims for losses related to the pandemic under business interruption insurance policies. The variation in the types of cover provided and wordings used mean it can be difficult to determine whether customers have cover and can make a valid claim. The FCA brought a test case to the High Court to help resolve this uncertainty as quickly as possible, and appeals at the Supreme Court were heard in November. The scope of the test case covered policy wordings held by approximately 370,000 policyholders.',\n",

Analysts’ expectations of earnings in three years’ time provide one perspective on those sectors perceived as most affected (Chart 1.2). These companies may be unable, or unwilling, to access additional external finance.',\n",
       " 'Smaller companies tend to: be more concentrated in those sectors most affected by the public health measures; have seen a greater increase in indebtedness relative to larger firms to date; and also may find their capacity for further borrowing limited because they have already borrowed heavily using the government schemes.',\n",

The share has fallen since May, driven by a faster than expected recovery in households’ earnings, but remains elevated compared with its pre-Covid level of 0.9%.',\n",

The share of private-sector employees on furlough, which reached around 40% in the April/May period, fell to around 8% ahead of the recent restrictions. It reached 15% in the first half of November as employees were once again placed on furlough in response to the restrictions.',\n",

The face value of ‘BBB-’ rated bonds across major currencies with a 50% chance of being downgraded in the next 90 days has more than halved since March. But the expected performance of bonds at a slightly longer — one to two year – horizon has worsened, with the share of sterling ‘BBB-’ rated bonds on ‘negative outlook’ having increased almost fivefold since March.',\n",

There was uncertainty, also, about the scale of monetary and fiscal responses that would be implemented to support the economy. It was unclear how these factors would impact upon macroeconomic outcomes, demand for bank lending, losses, and ultimately bank capital.

It effectively sets an implicit LTI cap for each borrower that depends on the term of the mortgage, the borrower’s spending commitments and the reversion rate on the mortgage. For example, a borrower seeking a 25-year mortgage with a reversion rate of 4% (and hence a ‘stress rate’ in the test of 7%) would be able to borrow 4.7 times their income if they could afford to spend 40% of income on mortgage payments.',\n",

At the point of that Report, the unemployment rate was projected to peak at around 7¾% in 2021 Q2, meaning more households could face difficulties in servicing their debts. When the economic outlook worsens or becomes more uncertain, lenders tend to charge higher interest rates to compensate for additional risk.

       " 'The recent increase in the proportion of mortgages extended at high LTI multiples reflects both demand and supply-side factors. For example, data on completions and market intelligence both suggest that the issuance of loans to first-time buyers — who typically borrow at higher LTI multiples — has been strong since the housing market reopened compared to other activity. Separately, over the first half of 2020 the average reversion rate decreased from 4.2% to 3.6%, as the Monetary Policy Committee’s cut to Bank Rate was passed through to lenders’ reversion rates.16 A lower reversion rate means that borrowers who might have otherwise been constrained by the affordability test, are able to access mortgages at higher LTIs.',\n",
       " 'The reversion rate series used in this calculation is a weighted average of quoted rates across lenders using constant market shares.',\n",
       " 'More generally, since their implementation, there is no evidence that the FPC’s measures have had a material impact on mortgage availability in aggregate.',\n",
       " 'The FPC’s mortgage market Recommendations work by limiting the amount that prospective mortgagors can borrow relative to their incomes. These measures operate alongside other constraints — dictated by lenders’ own internal risk appetites — that together influence how much a prospective mortgagor is able to borrow.',\n",
       " \"Assessing the precise impact of the FPC’s mortgage market measures at any time is difficult because what individual borrowers would have done in the absence of the measures is not directly observable. However, Bank staff have reviewed household level data to make a preliminary assessment of the extent to which the FPC's mortgage measures — and, specifically, the affordability test Recommendation — might be constraining renters who want to purchase a home.\",\n",
       " \"Given the distribution of incomes and savings, around 75% of renters are likely to be constrained in the amount they could borrow by a lack of sufficient savings to meet deposit requirements, and not by the FPC's policies.\",\n",
       " 'Put differently, they would pass the affordability test for any home on which they could afford a 5% minimum deposit, based on their current liquid asset holdings.',\n",
       " 'The remaining 25% of renters are in principle constrained in the amount they could borrow by their income. About 44% of this group — representing 11% of total renters — could afford the median first-time buyer property if the FPC’s measures were not in place and they were instead subject only to minimum affordability testing standards.17 And 36% of the group — 9% of total renters — are still able to pass the FPC’s affordability test in purchasing the median first-time buyer home in their region. This suggests that the FPC’s Recommendations might currently be constraining only around 2% of renters — as measured by the difference between the 11% and 9% figures mentioned above — from purchasing the median first-time buyer property.',\n",
       " \"In the absence of the FPC’s policies, the FCA’s Mortgages and Home Finance: Conduct of Business Sourcebook (MCOB) rules would apply. To estimate the additional impact of the FPC's policies, Bank staff have compared the properties that prospective first-time buyers could afford under these minimum affordability testing standards relative to the FPC's affordability test, using data from the latest wave of the Wealth and Assets Survey and the FCA Product Sales Data. Under minimum affordability testing, a property is considered affordable if mortgage repayments do not exceed 40% of income, given a 'stress rate' of 5% (i.e., a 100 basis points buffer over a 4% reversion rate) and a typical first-time buyer term of 30 years. Under the FPC's affordability test, a stress rate of 7% (i.e., a 300 basis points buffer over a 4% reversion rate) is used to assess affordability.\",\n",
       " 'Those affected are likely to be concentrated in regions where homes are more expensive relative to incomes, such as in London (Chart 4.3). But it is important to note that the measures do not necessarily prevent these households from entering the housing market. In practice, these renters may choose to save for a larger deposit and reduce the loan they take out, or adjust the size of the property they purchase.',\n",
       " 'Evidence from lending data is consistent with the conclusion that FPC policy is unlikely to be constraining the majority of prospective mortgagors. Overall, mortgage approvals have increased to levels slightly above those seen before the FPC’s Recommendations were introduced. And the share of first-time buyers — who are typically more reliant on high LTI borrowing — has increased (Chart 4.4). Therefore, it does not appear that the Recommendations have had a material impact on mortgage market activity since their introduction.',\n",
       " 'The insurance provided by the FPC’s Recommendations provides significant macroeconomic benefits... The FPC considered the benefits and costs of these Recommendations when it introduced them in 2014 and again when it reviewed them in 2017 and 2019. It judged that by guarding against a build-up in household debt the benefits of the measures in terms of financial and economic stability substantially outweighed any macroeconomic costs. It further judged that, without policy action, the risk of excessive household indebtedness would be material.',\n",
       " 'The FPC reviews the calibration and implementation of its Recommendations regularly. For example, in 2017 the FPC withdrew and replaced the affordability test Recommendation in order to promote consistency of implementation across lenders, with the aim of insuring against a future loosening in underwriting standards (see June 2017 Report).',\n",
       " 'In concluding its 2019 review, the FPC also noted that in the absence of these tools alternative policies to reduce the risks posed by excessive household debt — such as setting a higher Bank Rate than might otherwise be warranted, or raising the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) for banks — might be necessary, and that these would be much more costly to the wider economy and present a greater risk to the Committee’s secondary objective to support the Government’s economic policy of strong, sustainable and balanced growth.',\n",
       " 'The FPC views its mortgage market Recommendations as structural measures, intended to remain in place through cycles in the housing market (see December 2019 Report). A key aim of the Recommendations is to reduce risks to the economy associated with higher household debt, thereby supporting sustainable growth through financial and economic cycles. Nonetheless, the Committee monitors developments in the housing market and banks’ underwriting standards closely. As noted above, the FPC’s last review of its Recommendations in 2019 found no evidence that they were having a material impact on mortgage availability overall since they were introduced in 2014. That has remained the case since.',\n",
       " 'The FPC is reviewing the calibration of its mortgage market Recommendations.',\n",
       " 'The mortgage market Recommendations are intended to remain in place through cycles in the housing market, but the FPC is committed to revisiting the calibration of the measures in response to structural changes in the economic environment.',\n",
       " 'For example, staff analysis suggests that, if the share of borrowers with an LTI between 4 and 4.5 had not increased from the level before the FPC Recommendations were made, and the additional borrowers in that category were to obtain an LTI of 5 instead, the value of new mortgage lending since the measures were put in place would be only 1% higher than it is today.',\n",
       " 'Structural changes in the interest rate risk related to household finances. Increases in interest rates can lead to higher mortgage rates and, accordingly, higher mortgage payments, which then increase households’ debt-servicing burdens. There has been a substantial fall in longer-term bond yields since 2014. Moreover, the ‘equilibrium interest rate’ — the interest rate at which monetary policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary — has fallen to very low levels over recent decades, as a result of longer-term structural factors. Alongside that, since the global financial crisis, central banks in the UK and other countries have had to lower policy rates below the equilibrium rate to provide stimulus in response to headwinds to growth and inflation (see Box 1 of the August 2020 MPR). Consistent with these factors, the option-implied distribution of future interest rates suggests a lower probability of a 300 basis points rise than in 2014 (Chart 4.5). This suggests that households’ capacity to service debt is more likely to be supported by a prolonged period of lower interest rates than it was in 2014.',\n",
       " 'Changes in reversion rate spreads over quoted rates and Bank Rate. The affordability test is specified as a ‘buffer’ over reversion rates. The spread of reversion rates over quoted mortgage rates nearly doubled from around 130 basis points in December 2013 to around 250 basis points in December 2019 (Chart 4.6), as banks lowered their quoted mortgage rates, but not average reversion rates. The current wide spread between reversion rates and Bank Rate may, in part, be a response to pressure on lenders’ net interest margins caused by the very low level of Bank Rate since the global financial crisis. Lenders could restore the previous spread by passing on less of any future increase in Bank Rate to reversion rates. This would reduce the risk that reversion rates rise in the future.',\n",
       " 'Risks to household incomes and unemployment. Risks to household incomes and unemployment may have changed over time. While the calibration of the affordability test is expressed as a rate rise, it also seeks to ensure that households in aggregate are better able to withstand fluctuations in income and employment through an economic cycle.',\n",
       " 'The FPC will also assess the role and appropriate calibration of the LTI flow limit. The Committee has previously noted that it will consider the measures together when keeping the Recommendations under review.',\n",
       " 'Stablecoins are digital tokens that claim to maintain a stable value at all times, primarily in relation to existing national currencies. They could provide benefits to users. But they will be adopted widely and become successful as a safe and trusted means of payment only if they meet appropriate standards and confidence in their value is assured at all times. In particular, their users must be as sure of their ability to redeem their money in cash, at face value, at all times, as they are with private money ― commercial bank deposits ― that is in widespread circulation in the UK today.',\n",
       " 'Stablecoins are an innovation in payments that could be widely adopted.',\n",
       " 'Stablecoins are a type of ‘crypto’ (or ‘digital’) token that claim to maintain a stable value at all times, primarily in relation to existing national currencies. Their stability of value is what distinguishes them from other forms of crypto-assets which have proved too volatile for widespread use in payments. Their developers claim a number of benefits, such as increasing the speed and lowering the cost of domestic and international payments, and greater convenience through integration of stablecoin ‘wallets’ with other technology, such as social media platforms or online shopping services. If attractive to users, stablecoins could become widely used by households and businesses in the UK as a means of payment.',\n",
       " 'The FPC set out two expectations for widely used (‘systemic’) stablecoins in December 2019. The first expectation addressed the financial stability risks associated with the payment functionality of stablecoins: ‘Payment chains that use stablecoins should be regulated to standards equivalent to those applied to traditional payment chains. Firms in stablecoin-based systemic payment chains that are critical to their functioning should be regulated accordingly.’ To ensure this, the Bank — as the regulator of systemic payment systems with the objective of maintaining financial stability — would need to have the necessary powers over systemic payment firms that use stablecoins, including stablecoin issuers and wallets.',\n",
       " 'This expectation is part of the FPC’s broader principles for payments, which set out that: regulation should capture systemic payments chains end-to-end; payments firms should be regulated based on the risks they pose and not their legal form; and regulators should have enough information to monitor changes in payments.',\n",
       " 'Two types of money circulate and are used for transactions in the UK today: money issued by the public sector (cash and reserves held at the central bank); and money issued by private institutions (primarily the deposits of commercial banks). In recent decades, privately issued money has become more dominant as a means of payment. Around 95% of the funds people hold that can be used to make payments are now held as bank deposits rather than cash, compared to around two thirds in the 1980s (Chart 5.1).',\n",
       " 'The public needs to have complete trust in the reliability and stability of the money it uses every day. Ensuring this confidence is a vital role of central banks. The Bank of England protects the value of public money (cash and central bank reserves) in the United Kingdom. And in turn, rules and protections for commercial banks ensure that the private money they issue in the form of deposits can be used interchangeably with cash. These rules give households and businesses confidence that bank deposits can be redeemed in cash, at face value, at all times. To ensure this, banks are subject to extensive prudential regulation, have access to central bank liquidity facilities, and deposits are insured up to £85,000.',\n",
       " 'Stablecoins could be an additional type of ‘private’ money. If they are to be adopted widely then, as with bank deposits, confidence must be assured in the public’s ability to redeem their money in cash, at face value, at all times. The FPC’s second expectation addressed this: ‘Where stablecoins are used in systemic payment chains as money-like instruments, they should meet standards equivalent to those expected of commercial bank money in relation to stability of value, robustness of legal claim and the ability to redeem at par in fiat.’ Implementation of this expectation would maintain a payments landscape where users can substitute between different forms of money, without consequence for their level of protection. To ensure this remains the case in future, other forms of private money, such as e-money, would also need to meet the FPC’s expectation, were their issuers to become systemic.',\n",
       " 'The FPC is considering how the regulatory system can adapt to ensure this, while supporting innovation, in an efficient way.',\n",
       " 'Another possibility would be to back systemic stablecoins with central bank money in one form or another. Such an approach exists in the UK for private issuers of physical cash in Scotland and Northern Ireland. If a stablecoin were backed only by central bank money, it would be economically similar to a CBDC. This is an electronic form of central bank money that could be used by households and businesses to make payments. The discussion paper will therefore also explore questions about the role of the private and public sector in the provision of money, building on the Bank’s March 2020 CBDC Discussion Paper.',\n",
       " 'If they meet the necessary requirements and standards, systemic stablecoins could emerge as a substitute for commercial bank deposits as a means of payment. This could mean that deposits flow out of the banking system into stablecoin ‘wallets’. In recent decades, the increased prominence of electronic payments and declining use of cash in how people pay means that the money banks create increasingly stays within the banking system (Chart 5.1). But the growth of systemic stablecoins could mean a reversal of this trend, with more bank deposits ending up outside of the banking system. The extent of this potential reversal would depend on the size of the stablecoin balances people may wish to hold. That in turn would depend, in part, on how the benefits for users of holding stablecoins compare to the benefits of bank deposits. Where stablecoins are backed by a much narrower range of assets than loans typically held by banks, the financial system may need to adapt to maintain the supply of credit to the economy.',\n",
       " 'The FPC will consider whether there are particular aspects of systemic stablecoins that could make flows from a bank to a stablecoin more likely or more difficult to manage than flows between banks. It may be necessary to develop the existing mitigants. These could, for example, include: features of the stablecoin itself, such as remuneration or the quantity available; adjustments to the amount of liquid assets held by banks to self-insure against outflows of deposits; or development of the lending facilities at central banks that help banks to access liquidity in a stress. Further work is needed to explore the potential of this risk, its impact and severity and the relative effectiveness and viability of the available mitigants. The upcoming discussion paper will cover these points, with the aim of ensuring that the growth of stablecoin can be supported while maintaining or enhancing financial stability.',\n",

Other than changing the name of the buffer, the framework would remain substantively unchanged, and the economic substance of the buffer would not be impacted.
