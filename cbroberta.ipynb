Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting, with binding effect a year after that. This rate is reviewed on a quarterly basis.',\n",
       " 'The United Kingdom has also previously reciprocated a number of foreign CCyB decisions — for more details see the Bank of England website.(1) Under PRA rules, foreign CCyB rates applying from 2016 onwards will be automatically reciprocated up to and including 2.5%.',\n",
       " 'The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) should ensure that mortgage lenders do not extend more than 15% of their total number of new residential mortgages at loan to income ratios at or greater than 4.5. This Recommendation applies to all lenders which extend residential mortgage lending in excess of £100 million per annum. The Recommendation should be implemented as soon as practicable.',\n",
       " 'The PRA and the FCA have published their respective approaches to implementing this Recommendation: the PRA has issued a Policy Statement, including rules,(2) and the FCA has issued general guidance.',\n",
       " 'The FPC reviewed this Recommendation in November 2016 and decided not to amend the calibration. The explanation for this is set out in the November 2016 Financial Stability Report.',\n",
       " 'United Kingdom’. This is defined by Parliament, through the Bank of England Act 1998. The Court of Directors of the Bank has a statutory responsibility to determine the Bank’s strategy in relation to this objective and to review it at least every three years. Court has delegated the review of the strategy to the FPC, as permitted by the Act; but Court retains ultimate responsibility for the strategy.',\n",
       " 'At its 2017 Q2 meeting, the FPC agreed the Bank’s financial stability strategy, following its review of the strategy that was set by Court in 2014, and following consultation, as required by statute, with HM Treasury. The strategy will be published in the Bank’s forthcoming Annual Report.']"
